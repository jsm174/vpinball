IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

Since October 2020, we, the Visual Pinball team, were working on replacing
the inherited 'old MAME'-like license (listed directly below) by
the GPLv3+ License (listed at the very end of this file).
By now (October 2025), the vast majority of files have been made sure to
comply with the GPLv3+ License (by contacting the original authors, or
otherwise code re-writes).

Note that all new contributions (e.g. via pull requests) being made by any
contributor were and will automatically be considered as GPLv3+ based (unless
it includes thirdparty code, which must be pointed out accordingly).

In addition, each source file/snippet that is under GPLv3+ will have its
very first line marked with
// license:GPLv3+
Every file/snippet that doesn't feature any explicit license mentioning,
will stay (for now) under the 'old MAME'-like license.

Note that some files feature their own respective license(s) that come listed
directly within that specific file.

Also note that all external libraries (stored in the "third-party" folder)
come as-is, under their own respective license models, listed there, or
in "docs\license.txt".
