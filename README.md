# Visual Pinball

*An open source pinball table editor and simulator.*

This project was started by Randy Davis, open sourced in 2010 and continued by the Visual Pinball development team. This is the official repository.

## Features

- Simulates pinball table physics and renders the table with DirectX, OpenGL or [bgfx](https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/overview.html)
- Simple editor to (re-)create any kind of pinball table
- Live editing of most content within the rendered viewport
- Table logic (and game rules) can be controlled via Visual Basic Script
- Over 1050 real/unique pinball machines from ~100 manufacturers, plus over 550 original creations were rebuilt/designed using the Visual Pinball X editor (over 3000 if one counts all released tables, incl. MODs and different variants), and even more when including its predecessor versions (Visual Pinball 9.X)
- Emulation of real pinball machines via [PinMAME](https://github.com/vpinball/pinmame) is possible via Visual Basic Script (Visual PinMAME), or via the libPinMAME-API/plugin
- Supports configurable camera views (e.g. to allow for correct display in virtual pinball cabinets)
- Support for Tablet/Touch input, Joypads, or specialized pinball controllers
- Support for Stereo3D output
- Support for Head tracking via BAM
- Support for VR/XR HMD rendering (including [PUP](https://www.nailbuster.com/wikipinup), [B2S](https://github.com/vpinball/b2s-backglass) backglass and DMD output support)
- Support for WCG/HDR rendering (for now only via the BGFX (D3D11/12) build)
- Support for Windows (x86), Linux (x86/Arm, incl. RaspberryPi and RK3588), macOS, iOS/tvOS, Android (the latter builds are also available via the respective app stores for free)
- Plugin system to drive/fuel all kinds of displays (DMD, backglass, etc), add custom/dynamically-changed content (PUP, Serum, etc), direct output framework (DOF), sensors, and much more (WIP)
